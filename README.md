Peacock is a game engine for making beautiful games.

#### ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

Peacock is still very much a work-in-progress. You're welcome to use it and report any issues you find, but I make no promises about stability or supporting your specific use cases until we hit `1.0.0`.

## Installation

To install Peacock, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
peacock = "0.0.1"
```

If you're like me and enjoy living on the bleeding edge, you can use a `git` dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
peacock = { git = "https://github.com/maxdeviant/peacock" }
```

> Since we're still in the early days, I would suggest opting for the `git` dependency.

### Dependencies

Peacock is built on top of [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), so you will need to install the SDL2 libraries for your platform.

#### Nix/NixOS

```sh
nix-shell
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

If you're running a Debian or Ubuntu-based Linux distribution you can (most likely) do the following:

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

### macOS

```sh
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf
```

For other platforms check out the [`rust-sdl2`](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) docs.

## Usage

```rust
use peacock::graphics::{self, Color};
use peacock::{Context, ContextBuilder, Result, State};

struct GameState;

impl State for GameState {
    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }

    fn draw(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context, dt: f64) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    ContextBuilder::new("Hello, world!", 800, 600)
        .build()?
        .run(&mut GameState)
}
```

## Motivation

![xkcd: Standards](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

> Fig 1: The state of Rust game engines.

With the abundance of 2D game engines for Rust it does seem a little silly that I would add yet another one into the mix, so I'll do my best to explain my motivations for writing Peacock.

Up until recently I was using [`ggez`](http://ggez.rs) for my games, but it got to the point where it was pretty frustrating to work with. The `0.4.0` branch had a lot of shortcomings, bugs, and APIs that were on the chopping block. This led me to switch to the `devel` branch, which cleaned up some stuff, but in turn had issues of its own. Now, in light of [The State of GGEZ 2019](https://wiki.alopex.li/TheStateOfGGEZ2019), I figured it would be a good time to search for greener pastures.

[Tetra](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/) was the next engine to catch my eye, and at a glance it makes a lot of the same decisions I would for an engine. But having just come off `ggez` I found it hard to sell myself on an even more immature engine. Even the thought of getting in at the ground-floor and contributing to Tetra didn't quite appeal to me either.

This got me thinking about what it is that I really want in a Rust game engine. After some thought, I think what it really comes down to is control. I want to be able to build games the way I want to without worrying about hitching my cart to an engine that goes down a direction that doesn't align with my goals.

## Goals

- Safety
  - We're using Rust, so we want things to be safe
  - Some of our libraries make this difficult:
    - SDL2's C bindings are unsafe
    - Peacock doesn't directly depend on it (yet), but in userland `specs` likes to panic a lot
- "Batteries Included"
  - Peacock should have everything in it that allows you to get games off the ground fast
  - This may mean including things that aren't generic enough for _every_ game (e.g., input, pathfinding, etc.)
    - We may be able to investigate making things modular here, but we don't want to overdo it and turn into [Piston](https://www.piston.rs/)
- Consistent APIs

### Non-Goals

Things that I don't care about at this juncture:

- Targeting web and mobile devices
- 3D support

## Prior Art

Here are some of the engines that have served as inspiration for Peacock:

- [ggez](http://ggez.rs)
- [Tetra](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/)
- [luxe](https://luxeengine.com/)
- [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/)
